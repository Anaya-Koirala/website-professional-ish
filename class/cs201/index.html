    Here you can find my CS 201: Mathematics of Computation Fourth Hour project.
    This course was especially fun and involved topics in discrete maths, number theory, proofs, graph theory, probability and combinatorics.
    My fourth hour project involved writing a short paper on the properties of two graphs: one the popular Friendship graph and
    the other graph that we constructed ourselves, the "Spider" graph.
    It was challenging, but extremely rewarding and fun work. <br><br>

    <b>NOTE:</b> This paper is presented as is.
    It contains minor errors in the indexing of the set definitions of the graph.
    There were also places where the language could have been made clearer, and the conclusions to the point.
    However, we're proud to have scored a very high grade on this paper, and I learned a lot from writing it.
