    My fourth hour project for this class was the implementation of the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe"> Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game</a> in Flutter. <br> <br>
    The rules of the game are:
        <ul>
            <li> The game is played on a 3x3 grid of 3x3 tic-tac-toe boards. </li>
            <li> Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) on the smaller boards. </li>
            <li> The position of the mark on the smaller board determines which smaller board the next player must play on. </li>
            <li> If a player is sent to a board that is already won or full, they can choose any board to play on. </li>
            <li> The game is won by winning three smaller boards in a row on the larger grid. </li>
        </ul>

    <em>Note: The mobile version has a bug where X/O are rendered as Chinese characters. The game is still playable (and fun!). <br>
        Honestly, the Chinese characters add a certain flair, and I'd love to know what they mean.</em>
